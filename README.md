# Principles-of-Data-Libraries
This project employs the principles of data libraries to create a back end to this library book management application.  
Mp4 is a video of the application running.  
Book Library contains the back end of the application.  
The back end implements a CRUD interface, a book constructor and creates a list of books.  
The front end contains a WPF application with a login window and a Main Window.  
The login window uses a dictionary to compare key value pairs and validate login credentials.  
The Main Window utilizes the entry text boxes to validate data and displays it in a data grid.
